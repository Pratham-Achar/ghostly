/**
 * Conversation thread — the SECOND context layer, for technical / project
 * drill-downs.
 *
 * ── Why this is not `activeProblem` ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * `activeProblem` answers "what work are we doing?" — it holds a coding or
 * design problem that follow-up questions refer back to. This layer answers a
 * different question: "what have we been DISCUSSING?", where each turn is a
 * question and what Ghostly suggested in reply.
 *
 * The chain this exists for:
 *
 *   "What is Redis?"
 *   "Why did you use Redis in your project?"
 *   "What is the flow with Redis in your project?"
 *   "What happens when the cache misses?"
 *
 * By turn three, "the flow" is meaningless without turn two, and turn two is
 * meaningless without turn one. `activeProblem` cannot carry it: none of these
 * is a coding problem, and hanging a Redis discussion off it would both misfile
 * the discussion and destroy the real problem's context.
 *
 * ── What this layer must NEVER do ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *   NO MANUFACTURED PROJECT FACTS. The thread stores the topic, the recent
 *   questions, and Ghostly's own suggested answer heads. It never concludes
 *   "the project uses caching because the interviewer asked about Redis" and
 *   stores that as fact. Project facts come from the candidate profile only.
 *   The prompt says so explicitly, because a stored invented fact is
 *   indistinguishable from a real one on the next turn.
 *
 *   NO "WHAT YOU SAID". `answerHead` is an excerpt of an answer GHOSTLY
 *   PRODUCED. Ghostly has no candidate-microphone channel, so it cannot know
 *   what the candidate actually said. Every label says "earlier suggested
 *   answer", and the prompt spells out that these are not statements about the
 *   candidate.
 *
 *   NO LLM CALL. Sentence extraction and truncation are deterministic, so this
 *   cannot add latency, cost quota, or fail in a way that blocks an answer.
 *
 *   IN MEMORY ONLY. A thread that survived a restart would be wrong about what
 *   is being discussed, which is worse than having none.

 *      overlap on the most important case in the whole feature:
 *
 *        "What is the flow with Redis in your project?"
 *
 *      starts with "what is" — the exact shape of a standalone definition — and

 *      which drops the overlap below the threshold and removes the only thing
 *      that would have saved it. Ordering the new-subject test first therefore
 *      broke a drilled-down question precisely when the audio was worst, which
 *      is when the context is most needed. A cue is a positive signal and wins.
 *   4. No cue, but a standalone definition on an unrelated subject → no, and the
 *      caller REPLACES the thread. This is where "What is Docker?" lands: it
 *      matches no cue at all, so it is genuinely a fresh subject.
